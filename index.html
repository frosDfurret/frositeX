    Yup, I, uh, go through a lot of phases.
    <span class="brbutcool"></span>

      Hey! I'm daguil, your typical teenage internet dude (certified early-2010s web lurker). My hobbies include coding (duh), playing both retro and modern video games, making home movies, playing the piano, composing music (rarely), and hanging with friends! I also watch quite the unhealthy amount of YouTube in a day, haha... 
      <span class="brbutcool"></span>
      If you've stumbled across this site, you're likely either:
      <br>
      - One of my friends
      <br>
      - A random person looking through my Discord bio
      <br>
      - Someone who stumbled down the internet rabbit hole
      <br>
      - Option 4
      <br>
      In any case, I welcome you with open arms! Just don't hug too hard, I break easily. :')
      <span class="brbutcool"></span>
      When it comes to coding, I'm the type of guy who comes up with an idea, writes it down, and works on it 6-18 months later just to give up halfway. The projects I have finished aren't exactly the best, but I'm trying to whip up some bangers! Expect some games soon.
      <span class="brbutcool"></span>
      I've actually been coding for maybe 8 years now, and it's become second-nature (at least, the logic). Though I am quite reluctant in learning new languages (JavaScript genuinely gave me nightmares for a good 5 years) I'm always willing to at least try something new in order to turn my dumb dreams into a reality.
      <span class="brbutcool"></span>
      But yeah, that's me. If you want to reach out, check out my socials, where you can find me and my work on a whole bunch of different platforms. Interested in the (very few completed) things I make? Take a look at the projects page, which I'll end up updating every 5 or so millenia. I hope you'll enjoy these things as much as I enjoy making them. Ciao!
